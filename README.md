# fb-oembed-api-debug-test

This is a demonstration of the bug as reported at https://developers.facebook.com/bugs/1120612631391034/

When you query Facebooks oEmbed API using node, you will get an error page telling you to upgrade your browser. 
The problem can be worked around by setting the `User-Agent` to fake a supported browser.

## Description

This project uses the popular node library [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) and performs a simple 
`GET` request to [https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post/oembed.json/?url=https://www.facebook.com/FacebookforDevelopers/posts/10154088773123553](https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post/oembed.json/?url=https://www.facebook.com/FacebookforDevelopers/posts/10154088773123553).
It then logs the returned response body to the console.

If you open the URL in the browser, you will see an oEmbed-response JSON. The logged result will be a pile of HTMLâ€”the 
error page telling you to upgrade your browser.

To initialize the project do

    npm install

To run the test that logs the error page run

    npm run query-api

This npm task will run `index.js` using node.

To demonstrate the User-Agent issue, do

    npm run query-api-with-user-agent

which will run `index-with-useragent.js` using node. This is an exact copy of `index.js` with the only difference that 
the User-Agent has been set to fake the latest version of Chrome.
